âœ… Step-by-Step Guide to Create a Student Management System
ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Define the Requirements
Your system should:

    Add student records

    Display student records

    Update student records

    Delete student records

    Store records persistently using file handling

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Plan the Student Class

Attributes:

    Roll Number

    Name

    Course

    Marks

Methods:

    input() â€“ to accept student details

    display() â€“ to show student details

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Setup File Handling

You'll use a binary file (e.g., students.dat) to:

    Save new student records

    Read and display existing records

    Update/delete records by matching roll number

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Create Menu for Operations

Use a do-while loop and a switch-case to show the menu:

1. Add Student
2. Display All Students
3. Search Student by Roll No
4. Update Student
5. Delete Student
6. Exit

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Implement Core Functionalities

Functions to implement:

    addStudent()

    displayAll()

    searchStudent(int rollNo)

    updateStudent(int rollNo)

    deleteStudent(int rollNo)

ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Compile and Test

    Compile using g++ or any IDE (Code::Blocks, VS Code with C++ extension, etc.)

    Ensure that the file students.dat is created and updated as expected

    Test each functionality (add, update, delete, etc.)

ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Add Comments & Organize Code

    Add comments for clarity

    Split into multiple files later if needed: main.cpp, Student.h, Student.cpp
